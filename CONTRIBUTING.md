### Contributing to Netmiko

#### Clone the Netmiko repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko
cd netmiko
git statusdd
```

Git Status should look similar to the following:

```
$ git status
On branch develop
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/develop'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

#### Install Poetry 

Poetry is used to manage the dependencies needed for the Netmiko development environment. 

Make sure that you add Poetry to your $PATH.

[Poetry Install](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

```
# Verify Poetry is installed and in your $PATH

$ poetry --version
Poetry (version 1.x.y)
```

#### Use Poetry to install Netmiko dependencies

This will also create a virtual environment located in .venv.

```
# From the base of the Netmiko repository (the directory should contain the pyproject.toml file).
$ poetry install
<"Installing x"...>
```

#### Activate virtual environment that has all the needed dependencies:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Test your environment is working right:

```
# Should report all files as 'unchanged'
$ black --check .
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
264 files would be left unchanged.

# Linter should report nothing (at this point)
$ pylama .

# Type hints should be happy üòÉ
$ mypy netmiko/
Success: no issues found in 194 source files
```

Unit tests should pass (once again we are testing on unchanged 'develop' branch at this point so everything should pass)

```

#### Create a branch for your work:

```
$ git checkout -b my_cool_work origin/develop
branch 'my_cool_work' set up to track 'origin/develop'.
Switched to a new branch 'my_cool_work'
```

#### Make your changes pass the linters and tests. 

At the end of your changes the linters and unit tests MUST all pass.

```
cd {{ repo_base }}
# Use black to autoformat the code
black .

# Fix any linting errors
pylama .

# Type hints (if you struggle with this, submit PR and ask for assistance)
mypy netmiko/

# Unit tests
$ py.test tests/unit/
```

#### Submit your PR to the Netmiko repository. 

Place a clear statement regarding the purpose of the PR (bug it is fixing, feature it is adding).

For any more meaningful feature, you should open a GitHub issue or discussion first and make sure that we agree on implementing this feature.
